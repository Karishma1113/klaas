# NOVAA: Navigating Online Vulnerability & Achieving Autonomy

**Novaa** is a trauma-informed web platform designed to help domestic violence survivors protect their digital privacy. It provides visual, step-by-step privacy guides that walk users through securing devices, accounts, and personal information â€” without requiring advanced tech knowledge.

This project was created by the KLAAS team for the University of Washington iSchool Capstone and is being transitioned to open source as of **June 5, 2025** to support future development and iteration.
